            Smato Volcanos compense the largest percentage-60% of the Earth's
            indriydual volemees and most are characterized by eruptions of

            These more the viscous lanu allow gaa gai presses to build up to
            high levels (they are effective "plags" to the plumbing), therefore
            these volcanoes often suffer explosive eruptions Strato vulcanoes
            are usually about half half lavs and gyrch other name of composite
